= Simple weather app

== Getting started

To use this app, you need to register an http://openweathermap.org/appid[API Key] on the
http://openweathermap.org/[OpenWeatherApp] service.

You can create an `application-secrets.properties` in `src/main/resources` and add your
API key there:

```
app.weather.api.key=<yourkey>
```

TIP: The `application-secrets.properties` file is referenced in the `.gitignore` of the
project so you won't commit it by mistake.

If you don't like specifying the key in the project directly, you can set an OS
environment property instead, something like:

```
$ EXPORT APP_WEATHER_API_KEY=<yourkey>
```
